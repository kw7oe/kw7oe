Hi, I am Kai, based in Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾  (GMT +8).

- I started off my career as a Software Engineer and have experience working
  with frontend, backend, infrastructure and performance issues.
- I have experience in working with Elixir, TypeScript, React,
  React Native, Terraform, GitHub Action, AWS services and Docker.
- I'm lucky enough to be on [Thinking Elixir podcast][2] to share my
  experience with tracing performance problems in production.
- Along the way, I develop interest for lower level systems such as
  database system, networking, observability and etc.
- Hence, I've decided to pivot my careers towards working on lower level
  systems.

To make that a reality, I applied to the [Recurse Center][0] (RC) so I could spend
my time there to become a better programmer along with its community.
I am currently in the Spring batch at RC and working on:

- Writing a database system in Rust from scratch.
- Writing a reverse proxy like [ngrok][1] in Rust.
- Writing about how I implement a database system in Rust.

Outside of programming, I enjoy writing and sharing what I learned. You
can find out more about my writings at my [website][3].
